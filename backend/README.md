# Project Name

## Description
This code streams data from a device using the Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) protocol. It demonstrates how to connect to a data stream, pull samples, and print the output using Python.

## Requirements

Before running this code, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

### Python Packages
You'll need the Python `pylsl` package to handle the LSL protocol. You can install it using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pylsl
